<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to build a comprehensive platform for car rental and maintenance management called LocaTrack.

PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:
1.  **Fleet Management**: Vehicle registration (type, model, VIN, insurance), preventive/emergency maintenance alerts, and real-time GPS tracking via an external API ().
2.  **Contract Management**: Smart electronic contracts with digital signatures, flexible pricing/duration, and a central dashboard for contract status.
3.  **Government Integration (Algeria)**: Automatic management of traffic violations and generation of tax-compliant electronic invoices.
4.  **Customer Management**: Integrated database for customer identity, driver's licenses, and communication history with automated data verification.
5.  **Payments**: Flexible payment solutions in Algerian Dinar (DZD), including online (CIB, EDAHABIA) and manual methods.
6.  **Daily Operations**: Flexible booking system (create, modify, cancel), interactive car availability schedule, and accident/claims management.
7.  **Reporting & Analytics**: KPIs for fleet performance, customer behavior analysis, and comprehensive financial reports (revenue, costs, profitability).
8.  **User Interface**: Modern, user-friendly UI with full support for Arabic and French languages. The user has requested multiple design changes, finally settling on a futuristic light theme.
9.  **User Roles**: The system should support Admin and Employee roles. The initial request for a Client role has been revoked.
10. **Micro-interactions**: The application should include sound effects for user actions, with the volume set to 20%.

**User's preferred language**: French (fr-FR). The next agent MUST respond in French.

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack application with a FastAPI backend and a React frontend. The application is named LocaTrack.
- **Backend**: A  file with endpoints for users, vehicles, and dashboard stats. It uses JWT for authentication.
- **Frontend**: A complete set of pages has been created: , , , , , , , , , , and .
- **Styling**: A futuristic light theme is partially implemented. Most pages have been updated, but some UI inconsistencies (like yellow colors) remain.
- **Functionality**:
    - User authentication (Admin, Employee) is in place.
    - Sound micro-interactions are implemented via a  utility.
    - A critical runtime error  was partially fixed for  and  using a new  utility. However, the error persists on other pages.
    - All required pages and routes are set up in .

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working**: The agent was fixing a critical runtime error, . This error occurs when the frontend tries to display a backend Pydantic validation error object directly in a toast notification, which expects a string. The agent created a utility  to parse these error objects into readable strings and applied it to the  and .
-   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
-   **Agent Testing Done**: N
-   **Which testing method agent to use?**: Frontend testing agent. The agent must test all forms (add/edit modals) across the application, specifically for Fleet and Employees, by submitting invalid data to trigger validation errors and ensure they are handled gracefully without crashing.
-   **User Testing Done**: Y (User found the recurring bug after the partial fix).

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1: Critical Crash on Form Submission (P0)**
-   **Issue 2: UI Inconsistencies (P1)**

**Issues Detail**:
-   **Issue 1: Critical Crash on Form Submission (P0)**
    -   **Description**: The application crashes with the error  when submitting forms with invalid data on  and . The user has reported this issue is recurring. It is highly likely this bug also exists on all other pages with forms that haven't been updated.
    -   **Attempted fixes**: An  utility was created and successfully applied to  and . The fix was not propagated to other parts of the application.
    -   **Next debug checklist**:
        1.  Locate .
        2.  Import and apply this  function within the  block of all  calls in the following files:
            -    (for adding/editing vehicles)
            -    (for adding/editing employees)
        3.  Proactively check and apply the same fix to all other pages with forms: , , .
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: This is a critical, app-breaking bug. Fixing it will make the core data entry features of the application usable and stable.
    -   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
    -   **Is recurring issue?**: Y
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Frontend
    -   **Blocked on other issue**: None

-   **Issue 2: UI Inconsistencies (P1)**
    -   **Description**: The user has repeatedly requested the removal of all yellow color. However, a yellow highlight is still visible on the active menu item in the sidebar and on the success toast notifications from the  library.
    -   **Attempted fixes**: The agent has changed themes multiple times but has not specifically targeted these two elements.
    -   **Next debug checklist**:
        1.  **Sidebar Highlight**: In , locate the  components. Modify the  for the active state to use a color from the approved light theme palette (e.g., , ) instead of the current yellow.
        2.  **Toast Color**: In the files where  is called (e.g., ), inspect the  component in  or its UI component file. Customize its style to override the default yellow/green success color. Refer to the  library documentation for styling options.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: To meet the user's explicit design requirements and create a visually consistent application.
    -   **Status**: NOT STARTED
    -   **Is recurring issue?**: Y
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Frontend (screenshot tool is sufficient)
    -   **Blocked on other issue**: None

**In progress Task List**:
None. All efforts are part of the issues and upcoming tasks.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Backend**: FastAPI, Pydantic (for data validation), JWT (for authentication), Passlib/Bcrypt (for password hashing).
-   **Frontend**: React, React Router, Axios, TailwindCSS,  (for translation),  (for icons).
-   **UI Library**: shadcn/ui components,  for toast notifications.

**key DB schema**
The schema is implicitly defined by the Pydantic models in :
-   **User**: {username, email, password, role ('admin', 'employee')}
-   **Vehicle**: {make, model, year, license_plate, status, daily_rate, ...}
-   Other models for contracts, reservations, etc., are planned but not fully implemented in the backend.

**changes in tech stack**
None.

**All files of reference**
-   : **New and critical file.** Contains the logic to parse backend error messages for the frontend.
-   : Needs to be fixed using .
-   : Needs to be fixed using .
-   : Controls sidebar navigation and layout. Needs style fixes for the active link highlight.
-   : Contains all routes and protected route logic. Needs to be updated to remove client-related routes.
-   : Implements the sound features with volume control.
-   : Contains the test credentials.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- The backend logic is entirely within a single  file. As more features are added, it should be split into multiple files/routers for better organization (e.g., , ).
- API calls in the frontend are spread across component files. A dedicated API service layer could centralize  configurations and error handling.

**key api endpoints**
-   
-    (Login)
-   
-   
-   
-   Endpoints for other modules (employees, contracts, etc.) need to be created.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   The most critical task is to fix the  error. The solution () already exists but must be applied to all forms in the application.
-   The user has explicitly requested to **remove the client module**. This is a high-priority structural change.
-   The user is very sensitive to design and color. Do not use any **yellow** color. Ensure the active link highlight and toast notifications are updated to match the light theme.
-   Do not get distracted by implementing new features until the critical crash bug and the client module removal are completed.

-   **Planned**: Algerian payment gateways (CIB, EDAHABIA).
-   **Planned**: Local digital signature and e-invoicing solutions (details not specified).

**Testing status**
-   **Testing agent used after significant changes**: YES (but many changes were made afterward without re-running the agent).
-   **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop**: NO
-   **Test files created**: None.
-   **Known regressions**: A partial fix for a critical bug was introduced, but the bug resurfaced in other parts of the application, which the user identified.

**Credentials to test flow:**
Refer to . The agent created credentials for admin and employee roles. The client role should be removed.
- **Admin**: admin@vehicletrack.dz / admin123
- **Employee**: employee@vehicletrack.dz / employee123

**What agent forgot to execute**
-   The agent did not propagate the  fix to all necessary files, leading to a recurring critical bug report from the user.
-   The agent repeatedly missed fixing the yellow highlight on the active sidebar link despite multiple user complaints about the color yellow.
-   The agent has not yet started the user's request to remove the client module.</analysis>
